PollyDocket was first imagined as a tool to automate finding new eviction
dockets to aid court-support efforts in Pennsylvania. After word got out, other
groups expressed the need for such a tool in other efforts like bail funds.
The eventual goal is to expand this tool for use in all states.

## Features

* Asynchronously run many docket searches simultaneously
* Automated splitting of searches with "too many" responses
* Docket sheet parser
